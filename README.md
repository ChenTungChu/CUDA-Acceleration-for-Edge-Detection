# CUDA-Acceleration-for-Edge-Detection

Used CUDA with GPU acceleration for edge detection analysis and comparison on different image size and the process speed for different number of pictures.
Deployed Sobel filter as our edge detection method and compared the process time difference in sequential method, parallelization with openMP, and CUDA acceleration.
